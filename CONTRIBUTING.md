## LostGrid Contributing Guide

First off, thanks for wanting to help!

If this is your first time contributing to an Open Source Project, welcome!

## Pre-requisites

1. Ensure what you're writing has test coverage.
2. Lint before you commit _([Yes, Peter's still working on this](https://github.com/peterramsing/lost/commit/293cd9254ce44c28c0a742c62b4e441ce6d07b5b))_

- Don't be like Peter...use the [Git Hook](#git-hooks-for-lostgrid) like he does now. ðŸ¤“
- Lint by running `npm run lint`
- Don't worryâ€“the Continuous Integration will enforce this if you forget.

## Notes

- If this is your first commit/contribution to an open-source project, you got this far and you should feel epic!
- Whenever a PR is submitted, Peter's phone chirps and he does a little dance. ðŸ•º

Thanks, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
